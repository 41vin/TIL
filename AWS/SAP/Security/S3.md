# Events in S3 Bucket

- S3 Access Logs:
  - Detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket
  - Might take hours to deliver
  - Might be incomplete (best effort)

- S3 Events
  - Received notifications when certain events happen in your bucket
  - E.g.: new objects created, object removal, restore objects, replication events
  - Destinations: SNS, SQS queue, Lambda
  - Typically delivered in seconds but can take minutes, notification for every object if versioning is enabled, else risk of one notification for two same object
    write done simultaneously
  - Trusted Advisor:
    - Check the bucket permission (is the bucket public?)
  - Amazon EventBridge:
    - Need to enable CloudTrail object level logging on S3 first
    - Target can be Lambda, SQS, SNS, etc...

# S3 Security

- User based
  - IAM policies - which API calls shoud be allowed for a specific user from IAM console

- Resource Based
  - Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
  - Object Access Control List(ACL) - finer grain
  - Bucket Access Control List(ACL) - less common

<br><br>

# S3 Bucket Policies

- Use S3 bucket for policy to:
  - Grant public access to the bucket
  - Force objects to be encrypted at upload
  - **Grant access to another account (Croos Account)**

- Optional Conditions on:
  - **SourceIP**: Public IP or Elastic IP | **VpcSourceIP**: Private IP (through VPC Endpoint)
  - Source VPC or Source VPC Endpoint - only works with VPC Endpoints
  - CloudFront Origin Identity
  - MFA

# S3 pre-signed URLs

- Can generate pre-signed URLs using SDK or CLI
  - For downloads (easy, can use the CLI)
  - For uploads (harder, must use the SDK)
- Valid for a default of 3600 seconds, can change timeout with --expires-in [TIME_BY_SECONDS] argument
- Users given a pre-signed URL inherit the permissions of the person who generated the URL for  GET/PUT

<br>
- **Examples**:
  - Allow only logged-in users to download a premium video on your S3 bucket
  - Allow an ever changing list of users to download files by generating URLs dynamically
  - Allow temporarily a user to upload a file to precise location in our bucket

# S3 Object Lock & Glacier Valut Lock

- S3 Object Lock
  - Adopt a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
  - Bloc kan object version deletion for a specified amount of time
 
- Glacier Valut Lock
  - Adopt a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
  - Lock the policy for future edits (can no longer be changed)
  - Helpful for compliance and data retention

# S3 - Access Points

- Access Points simplify security management for S3 Buckets
- Each Access Point has:
  - its own DNS name (Internet Origin or VPC Origin)
  - an access point policy (similar to bucket policy) - manage security at scale
<br><br>

# S3 - Access Points - VPC Origin

- We can define the access point to be accessible only from within the VPC
- You must create a VPC Endpoint to access athe Access Point (Gateway or Interface Endpoint)
- The VPC Endpoint Policy must allow access to the target bucket and Access Point
<br><br>

# S3 - Multi-Region Access Points

- Provide a global endpoint that span S3 buckets in multiple AWS regions
- Dynamically route requests to the nearest S3 bucket (lowest latency)
- Bi-directional S3 bucket replication rules are created to keep data in sync across regions
- **Failover Controls** - allows you to shift requests across S3 buckets in different AWS regions within minutes (Active-Active or Active-Passive)
<br>

# S3 Object Lambda

- Use AWS Lambda Functions to change the object before it is retrieved by the caller application
- Only one S3 bucket is needed, on top of which we create **S3 Access Point** and **S3 Object Lambda Access Points**.
- Use Cases:
  - Redacting personally identifiable information for analytics or non-production environments
  - Converting across data formats, such as converting XML to JSON
  - Resizing and watermarking images on the fly using caller-specific details, such as the user who requested the object
